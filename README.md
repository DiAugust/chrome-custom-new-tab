All I really wanted was to configure a specific web page to show up when I
open a new tab in Chrome. No less and _definitely_ no more. But any existing
Chrome extension I found wanted to do way more and was asking for all kinds of
permissions. So I wrote my own:

1. A dead-simple configuration to set a site URL to which to forward.
2. No special permissions needed.
3. Can be used offline, even though that probably does not make much
   senseâ€“unless some URL on your own machine should be your home page,
   which is certainly possible ... as long as you have a local web server.
